## General info
If you're an NBA fan, you know it is hard to watch every game to see how your favorite players and teams are doing. We created a one-stop-shop where you can track your favorite players and teams. This web app has the following interactive functionalities: 
- Find stats for specific teams or players
- Save these teams or players so you can continue to reference them over time
- Reference a five year analysis of each player's stats.


---

## Technologies
The frontend of the app runs on React, with the backend API running on Rails and PostgreSQL. You can find details on our API [here](https://github.com/crayray/nba-stats-tracker-backend). 

All NBA stats data is pulled from the [API-NBA](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/details) API. 

We are also using Semantic UI for the components. 


## Requirements
This app will require the following:
- React
- Semantic UI package

## Installation
Download the project files and run:
```
// â™¥ npm install
```
Follow the Installation instructions from the [backend repository](https://github.com/crayray/nba-stats-tracker-backend) to ensure you can authenticate.
